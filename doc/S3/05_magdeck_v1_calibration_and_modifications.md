# OT-2 Magnetic Module V1 (magdeck) calibration and modifications

Magdecks V1 may have all their magnets in an unbalanced surface, making the magnets to be an uneven distance from the wells when engaging.

You must make sure that all magnets are at the same high across its surface by using a level and following the next steps.

## Steps

1) Use a levelling tool to check where your magdeck suffers this issue or not.

2) The magdeck can be completely disassembled using only a screw driver, but you will probably not need to go so far in most cases. Here is a n example of all the pieces in the magedck, in case you want to tinker with it or you need to fix something inside.

3) Usually you will only need to level this platform, on top of which is located the surface with the magnets.

4) In order to find the right position of the platform, you do not even need to dismantle the magdeck. Just find these four screws on the side and loose them a little until the platform gets loose. Put it in a levelled position and carefully screw them back in position trying to keep the balance. You may need to leave one or two a little loose to achieve a decent calibration.
