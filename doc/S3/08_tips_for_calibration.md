# OT-2 Modifications recommended for tips used in calibration

When calibrating, it is sometimes difficult to see where exactly the edge of the tip is, specially under bad light circumstances or when calibrating the deck.

We propose the following tips to make it an easier experience:

- Always make sure you have good lighting. If the internal led strips of your robot work, turn them on and that should be enough.

- Paint your tips edges with a red permanent marker, so it is easier to see them when calibrating.

- If possible, calibrate always using a single channel p20. The shorter the tip is, the better the calibration. Avoid at all costs calibrating with a single channel p1000.

- If you have to calibrate with a p1000, use a 3D printed solution attached to the pipette instead of a tip to get better results.

- Be careful if you have to use a multichannel pipette to calibrate, as it will crash against the walls of the robot in certain positions. Avoid if possible.
