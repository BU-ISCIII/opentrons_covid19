## Version 1.10

New features:
- New labware configuration: Biotix tips for 300 and 1000 configured in all protocols.
- New labware configuration: axygen pcr plate configured in required protocols.

Protocol modifications:
- Waste disposal height modified, now the liquid waste is dispensed above the reservoir.
- Aspiration in washes is modified from 220 to 210 ul to avoid the liquid touching the tip filters.
- Change magnet height to 23 mm when using vwr deep well plates.
- Removed reuse tips for elution steps in extraction protocol.
- Now remove trash pause is prompted before the incubation pause.

Documentation:
- Added calibration docs. Protocol, multichannel pipette and magdeck calibration.

## Version 1.9

New features:
-

Protocol modifications:
- Protocol B now aspirates larger volumes of supernatant and washes than dispensed, in order to remove residual volumes left due to pipetting error and drops attached to tips.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed bug robot trying to send request when simulating

## Version 1.8

New features:
- Reduced dispense speed when dispensing washes from the top of the wells to avoid spaying in protocol B.
- Implemented reuse of tips for elutes in protocol B.
- Added double definition of labware to fuse both reuse tips protocol B options in only one files.

Protocol modifications:
- Increased supernatant removal to 810 ul to remove all of it in protocol B.
- Removed reuse of first tip in washes in protocol B.
- Protocol B labware layout has now two possible configurations, a legacy one for the old version of the protocol without tips reuse and the new optimised one.
- Protocol C does not mix master mix any longer if not prepared in the machine to avoid creating bubbles.

Bug fixes:
- Replaced default plate for biorad in protocol C.
- Fixed tip tracking for the case where we have same p20 both multi-channel and single-channel in protocol C.
- Fixed bug not transferring samples for exactly 8 samples with multi-channel in protocol C.
- Fixed bug not changing trash for 48 samples exactly in protocol B.
- Fixed bug added missing pick up tip for protocol C.
- Fixed bug mm_tube not decalred in protocol C.

## Version 1.7

New features:
- Added json sending using request. Requests python module is installed in all robots.
- Automatic tests added using github actions for all protocols (except C station due to a bug in opentrons_simulate v.3.17.0 )
- New protocol for using multi p20 pipette in station C for transferring extracts.
- Now there are two pauses in B station for removing trash tips when > 48 samples. One after mix y another after remove_supernatant.
- Added tip-reuse option for Station B protocol 1 (extraction).
- Added labware definition for biotix tip rack 300 ul (needs testing).
- Added labware definition for biotix tip rack 1000 ul (needs testing).
- Added labware ecogen deepwell to protocols A (this was missing in last release).

Protocol modification:
- For MM3 distribution in station C protocol 1 tip is changed every three columns.
- Once mastermix is mixed in station C protocol 1 tip is changed.
- Only one p20 rack tips in station C protocol 1 in slot 6.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed unset variable in dispense_beads protocol 1 station B. 2ab984b

## Version 1.6
Hotfix:
- Fix bug in hommogenize function in C protocol, used pip instead of
p300.

## Version 1.5
Hotfix:
- Removed comments where MAGNET_HEIGHT variable that were bothering
opentronsweb

## Version 1.4
Documentation:
- Added user manual in spanish and english.
- Added how to ethernet connect your robot.
- Added how to calibrate.
- Added ssh connection guide.

New features:
- Voice messages language optional (spanish and english)
- Added tip count reset option.
- Added calibration scripts checking for all protocols.
- Now beads dilution is optional in protocol 2 station A. b2b5444
- Now volume_elute in station C is a parameter to be included by the user.67f881f
- Only pause for empty trash if samples > 48 in protocol B. 406c79a
- Added json generation with run info in each protocol. This will be used for api connection with openrobots web.
- New labware configuration for ecogen deep well, added to station A and B protocols.

Protocol modifications:
- Now incubation time in protocol B is 7 minutes.
- Reduced height in beads mix in protocol 2 station A, as it was taking some air sometimes. 53789ad
- Increased height in beads mix in protocol 1 station B, as it was too close to the bottom.
- Increased height in aspirates on on the plate above the magdeck, as it was sometimes touching the bottom.
- Protocol now B starts with magdeck off. 6031d94
- Fixed issue where m300 would go too deep and not aspire correctly in elution buffer. 40410be
- Fixed issue where m300 would not aspirate correctly in all wells in supernatant removal, washes an elution when magnet is engaged. Aspiration height is increase to 1.5.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed tip not dropping tip in p300 (protocol C) 9280ae8
- Fixed correct pick up and drop tip for correct tip count for negative control (protocol C) 3483d15
- Fixed correct drop tip for p300 (protocol C) 2e6cca7
- Fixed tip count issue when only one pipette is used. 80b9567
