## OT2 Magdeck V1 Elevator Frame

The magnetic module V1 is too strong and attracts magnetic beads even when disengaged. But the V2 version is too weak, so we need to fix tinker around to fix this.

We have created a 3D printable elevator frame designed to raise the plate above the magnetic field of the magnetic module when disengaged.

The printable file is [OT2 Magedck V1 Elevator Frame](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9f8oLel816s-ot2-magedck-v1-elevator-frame), you can find the .stl in this same folder, and can be also found in Tinkercad. It is licensed under Atribution 3.0 (CC-BY 3.0).
